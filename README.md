The application will feature four categories of exoplanets—Gas Giants, Terrestrial Planets, Neptunian Planets, and Super-Earths. Users can select any category to view:
•	A representative planet image sourced from the NASA Exoplanet Archive,
•	Detailed features and characteristics of the planet type,
•	Example exoplanets discovered by Kepler and TESS missions, and
•	Informative descriptions explaining their formation and composition.
All data and visuals are obtained directly from NASA’s official databases and educational resources, ensuring scientific credibility and accuracy.
